            <p>The Quiz component has reciveved an upgrade with new challenging question types. You can still use your <b>multiple choice</b>                questions and next to that you can now use <b>group</b>,
                <b>fill in the blanks</b> and <b>form a sentence</b> formats!
            </p>

            <b>Special syntax</b>
            <p>There is a special syntax you can use with double brackets to indicate that that [[word]] of [[multiple words]]
                are one part of a sentence. You can also add additional words to make the question harder to answer. </p>

            <b>Outdated</b>
            <p>Some quizes are now marked <span class="label label-warning">Outdated</span> to indicate that they are still
                in the old format.</p>
